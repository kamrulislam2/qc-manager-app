# 🌟 QC App — Unified Office Leave Tracker & Quotes Manager

**Version 3.3.1** | A premium, modern, and high-performance desktop and web utility built with **Next.js (TypeScript)**, **Supabase (PostgreSQL)**, and **Tauri v2**. It integrates two comprehensive corporate workspaces under a single secure, role-based role management structure.

---

## 🚀 Workspace Ecosystem

The QC App consists of two primary corporate workspaces, accessible dynamically based on administrator-configured employee access permissions:

### 1. 📅 Leave Tracker Workspace (Chuti)
*   **Sign-In / Sign-Out Panel**: One-click logging of daily attendances with customizable default shifts.
*   **Live Work Hours Tracking**: Realtime calculation of daily office hours and active break durations.
*   **Leave Submissions**: Request workflows for 4 distinct leave categories:
    - **Full Leave** (Annual leave and Eid vacation days)
    - **Short Leave** (Hourly personal absences)
    - **Overtime** (Logging of extra hours)
    - **Reserve Holiday** (E.g., working on official holidays to bank leave days)
*   **Government Holiday Banners**: 
    - Users with reserve capabilities enabled can choose between taking holiday pay ("Get Paid") or reserving it for future leave adjustment ("Reserve").
    - Users with reserve disabled automatically receive pay addition notifications (bypassing unnecessary screens and admin approvals).
*   **Bulk Full Leave Submission**: Add up to 10 separate dates simultaneously using an interactive calendar panel. In supervisor/admin dashboards, these dates are grouped into a **single, unified action row** for one-click approval, rejection, or revision request.
*   **Leave Deficit Adjustments**: Easily request adjustments using accrued overtime hours or reserve holidays to offset short leave deficits.

### 2. 📝 Quotes Manager Workspace
*   **Compliance Audit Panel**: Conduct deep compliance rules checking on corporate document types (e.g. PDF/Excel quotes).
*   **Rules & Configuration Engine**: Administrators and authorized managers can create, edit, or delete compliance checking rules, viewing execution histories.
*   **Category Checklist Selector**: Permissions specify allowed document categories (e.g. Van, Bike) per staff account.
*   **Can Manage Rules Permission**: Restricts compliance database edits to specific staff members (always allowed for Admins).

## 🔑 Administrative Control & Dashboard

A master control panel allows Administrators and Supervisors to oversee company-wide operations:
*   **Employee 360° Profile Hub**: Clicking any staff in User Management opens a full hub — Leave History, Quotes History, KPI & Performance, and Profile Settings sub-tabs — for a complete employee overview.
*   **Switchable Notification Panels**: Admins toggle between the Admin Approval Panel (detailed request cards) and their personal User Notification Panel. Session preference is remembered.
*   **Inline User Configuration**: The old pop-up modals have been replaced by a premium inline settings page (`StaffSettingsForm`). Setting up a new staff account or editing an existing profile uses the exact same layout.
*   **Circular UI Components**: All checkbox selectors (Leave settings, Govt Holidays, Overtime, Reserve, Can Manage Quote Rules) are styled as perfect circular inputs.
*   **Smooth Slide Transitions**: Workspace access toggles feature premium sliding toggle track animations.
*   **Standardized Field Heights**: All dropdown selectors and text fields are locked to consistent heights (`h-[36px]`) to align perfectly.
*   **Password Setup Enforcement**: Users logging in with the default password `1234` are immediately presented with a credentials modal, blocking dashboard navigation until they specify a custom secure password.
*   **Automatic 10-Minute Lockout**: New accounts must complete their profile within 10 minutes, backed by a persistent localStorage timestamp preventing timer bypass on reboot or window closing.
*   **Cascading Profile Deletion**: Removing a user account triggers PostgreSQL cascade constraints to clean up all related attendance, leaves, rules, and push subscriptions.

---

## 📶 Offline-First & Realtime Architecture

*   **PWA Service Worker (`sw.js`)**: Caches static assets for lightning-fast loading and offline availability. Restricts caching to GET requests to protect against cache poisoning.
*   **IndexedDB Sync Storage (`offlineSync.ts`)**: Locally queues signs, sign-outs, and leaves when offline, syncing automatically once connection is restored.
*   **Supabase Realtime Listeners**: Replication broadcasts instantly update metrics, list views, and tables on database changes without requiring manual refresh.
*   **Concurrent Push Notifications**: Integrates Web Push API using VAPID keys, with rate-limiting (maximum 1 request per 5 seconds per staff to prevent network spam). Admins and supervisors bypass rate limits to handle bulk approval actions.
*   **Tray Persistence (Tauri Desktop App)**: Minimizing or closing the app window hides it to the system tray, keeping it active in the background to deliver desktop notifications.

## 📜 Version History / Changelog

### 🚀 v3.3.1 — Patch Release (Current)
*   **Minimal Scrollbar Aesthetics**: Implemented a global, custom `.custom-scrollbar` utility style (thin, transparent by default, fading in on hover) and applied it to custom select dropdowns, user notifications modal, and leave approval panels.
*   **Notifications Persistence & Expiry**: Extended dismissed notifications persistence in local storage to 30 days (preventing them from reappearing after 1 day). Automatically filter out non-actionable informational notifications older than 7 days from the list.
*   **React Hook Purity Fix**: Resolved an ESLint compilation error where `Date.now()` was called inside `useMemo` by substituting it with the stable `currentSessionTime` timestamp.

### 🚀 v3.3.0 — Minor Release
*   **macOS & Windows Unified Auto-Updater Pipeline**: Integrated a custom updater builder script (`combine-latest-json.js`) into the GitHub Actions build workflow. This merges signatures and artifact payloads from both Windows and macOS platforms into a single, clean `latest.json` file on release, resolving the 404/signature validation issue.
*   **macOS System Integration**: Restored macOS native menu functionality (`Menu::default`) including support for native keyboard shortcuts (`Cmd+A`, `Cmd+C`, `Cmd+V`, `Cmd+X`, and `Cmd+R` for page reload).
*   **Profile Leave History Syncing**: Fixed a syncing issue where self-submitted leaves (made by Admin, Supervisor, or normal users) were not showing up under User Profile leave history. Now, pending/approved leaves are correctly visible across both the User Dashboard and the User Profile details in the User Management tab.

### 🚀 v3.2.0 — Minor Release
*   **Database-Level Badge Syncing**: Migrated top performer badge calculations, consecutive month streaks, and annual wins computation entirely to PostgreSQL level (`sync_top_performer_badges` RPC). Removed client-side heavy record fetching (up to 15,000 records) to eliminate memory overhead, network delays, and connection pool issues.
-   **User Leave Editing & Supervisor Access Delegation**:
    *   Implemented Temporary Access Delegation modal for supervisors to securely delegate their team's view/approval roles using circular checkbox selectors and circular context menu items (Edit & Remove Access) loaded directly under body portal context menus.
    *   Allowed normal users to edit their own leave records. Modified `needsReapproval` checking to reset leave requests back to `pending_supervisor` when settled requests are edited.
    *   Added full admin/supervisor editing capabilities for user sign-in/out times, break durations, working hours, and job roles.
*   **Decoupled Badge Display & UI Enhancements**: Completely removed `localStorage` caching of computed badges. Rendered all top performer badges directly from the database's `profilesList` state across Navbar, User Management, and Leaderboards to prevent mismatches or stale visual updates. Removed redundant `Total` text wrap constraints inside leave usages summaries.

### 🚀 v3.1.0 — Minor Release
*   **Team Daily Leave Records Report**: Implemented a comprehensive daily leave records dashboard allowing supervisors to filter and view their team members' active daily leaves (full & short leaves), and administrators to view all organization daily leaves. Supported custom Excel and PDF exports with dynamic filename formatting.
*   **Custom Skeleton Loaders & UX Improvements**: Designed new tailor-made skeleton loaders (`team-leaves-report` and `leaves-table` variants) to seamlessly match loading columns and eliminate action button grids. Fixed Back button routing navigation to exit directly to the leave application landing tab.
*   **Code Quality & Linting Compliance**: Resolved React conditional hook violations and cleaned up unused lucide imports, unused variables, and type safety constraints (such as `any[]` array responses in Excel helpers and Postgrest catch block type bindings) to ensure clean next build compilation.

### 🚀 v3.0.9 — Patch Release
*   **Rebuilt Cross-Platform Auto Updater**: Re-architected `AppUpdater` from scratch for Tauri v2 using `downloadAndInstall()` and `@tauri-apps/plugin-process` relaunch, ensuring seamless, robust auto-update installations on macOS and Windows.

### 🚀 v3.0.8 — Patch Release
*   **Eliminated Double Reload & UI Flickering**: Implemented optimistic state updates for adding, deleting, and adjusting leave entries in User Management > Leave History view, along with silent background data refetching.

### 🚀 v3.0.7 — Patch Release
*   **User Profile Settings Visibility & Admin Approval Workflow**: Enabled direct editing of profile details (Full Name, Job Role, Working Hours, Break Minutes, Default Sign-In/Out) for regular employees and supervisors. Submitting changes creates a pending profile update request for Admin approval, while keeping fields editable before submission.

### 🚀 v3.0.6 — Patch Release
*   **Direct Supabase Leave Insertion**: Resolved desktop app (Tauri) `Failed to fetch` error by inserting leave entries directly through Supabase JavaScript SDK, bypassing external serverless API dependency.
*   **Double Reload Prevention**: Added debounced fetch execution wrapper in User Management Dashboard to prevent duplicate data refetching and UI reloading when performing leave additions or deletions.
*   **Official Base URL Configuration**: Updated `apiUrlHelper.ts` and `.env.local` to use the official Vercel base domain `https://qc-manager-y4bzh900h-kamrul-projects.vercel.app`.
*   **Leave Usage & Stat Card Styling**: Enhanced font sizes for remaining hours and minutes display under Allocated Office Leave in user stats and leave summary cards.

### 🚀 v3.0.5 — Patch Release
*   **Session Lifetime & Auth Robustness**: Implemented auto-refresh token checks prior to submission and fallback logic in supervisor and push route handlers to avoid stale JWT errors.
*   **Custom Alert Confirmation Modal**: Replaced standard browser `confirm` prompts with custom modal designs when deleting leaves in the user profile view.
*   **Right-Click Protection**: Disabled default browser context menus globally while keeping custom project context menus operational. Also disabled custom context menu options for supervisors on non-deletable records.
*   **Linter & Styling Cleanup**: Resolved all remaining TypeScript compiler warning types and corrected Tailwind class formatting.

### 🚀 v3.0.4 — Patch Release
*   **Startup Auto-Update Installation**: Implemented automatic update downloading, installation, and relaunch on application startup, bypassing the manual restart button prompt.
*   **Warning Resolution**: Cleaned up the final explicit `any` linter warning inside the updater checker.

### 🚀 v3.0.3 — Patch Release
*   **Vercel Analytics Integration**: Switched `@vercel/analytics/react` to `@vercel/analytics/next` in the App Router root layout to utilize Next.js-specific optimizations.
*   **Permanent Spellcheck Fix**: Configured workspace settings to disable VS Code CSpell alerts, resolving formatting underline warnings globally.

### 🚀 v3.0.2 — Patch Release
*   **Project-wide Codebase Review & Cleanup**: Cleaned up over 260 compiler and linting warnings. Removed unused states, imports, and variables across `chuti/page.tsx`, `quotes/page.tsx`, and `DashboardModals.tsx`.
*   **Strongly Typed IP Checker**: Defined safe, typed interfaces for 6 external geolocation databases in `IPCheckerModal.tsx`, eliminating all explicit `any` types and improving code robustness.
*   **Production Build Optimization**: Confirmed TypeScript compilation matches 0 error status and compiles without warnings.

### 🚀 v3.0.1 — Patch Release
*   **User Management Loading Fixed** — Admin & Supervisor user list was failing to load in the desktop app because API calls were using relative paths that don't resolve in the Tauri webview. All API calls now correctly route to the Vercel backend.
*   **Real Download Progress** — The app updater now shows the actual download percentage (e.g. "Downloading v3.0.1… (45%)") instead of a fake pulsing bar.
*   **macOS Auto-Update Fixed** — Added `process:allow-restart` capability so the updater can successfully relaunch the app after installing an update on macOS.

### 🚀 v3.0.0 — Major Release
*   **Server-Persisted Verified Badges**: Shipped a robust backend synchronization system for verified performer badges. This resolves the RLS security restriction conflict where normal staff computed incorrect leaderboard ranks and faked badges locally. Badges are now calculated by the Admin at runtime and saved securely in each user's `global_settings.top_performer_badge` profile record.
*   **Top 5 Leaderboard Priority & Badges**: Leaderboard ranks are locked to the Top 5. The Top 1–3 performers receive a blue verified performer badge, and the Top 4–5 performers receive a grey verified performer badge.
*   **Leaderboard Filtering Updates**: Removed the dynamic team average filter and the tie-breaker rank filter. The leaderboard list now displays the complete Top 5 performance records without rank suppression.

### 🔧 v2.0.1 — Patch Release
*   **Critical Tauri Login Fix**: Users were unable to log in on the desktop app (macOS/Windows) while the web version worked. Root cause was the Supabase client using auth defaults incompatible with Tauri's static WebView (no server-side redirect). Fixed with `detectSessionInUrl: false`, `flowType: 'pkce'`, and explicit `localStorage` binding.
*   **Auto-Updater Unified & Fixed**: Removed duplicate `QuotesAppUpdater`. The single `AppUpdater` now uses correct Tauri v2 detection (`__TAURI_INTERNALS__`), correct `check()` API, and `plugin-process relaunch()` (the old `custom_relaunch` Rust command didn't exist).
*   **macOS DMG Build Fix**: Added `chmod +x bundle_dmg.sh` CI step to fix `failed to bundle project` error on `aarch64-apple-darwin`.
*   **Password Reset RECOVERY Fix**: Changing a user password no longer falsely triggers the RECOVERY database restore system.

### 🚀 v2.0.0 — Major Release
*   **Employee 360° Profile Hub**: Clicking any staff in User Management now opens a full-featured hub with sub-tabs — Leave History, Quotes History, KPI & Performance, and Profile Settings — giving admins a complete employee overview in a single screen.
*   **Switchable Admin/User Notification Panels**: Admins can toggle between a detailed Admin Approval Panel (full leave/profile/password request cards with one-click actions) and a personal User Notification Panel. The last-opened panel preference is persisted per session.
*   **Newest-First Todo Ordering**: Newly added tasks always appear at the top of the todo list.
*   **Profile Change Detection Guard**: Profile update submissions are blocked if no fields were changed, eliminating redundant approval cards in the admin queue.
*   **Isolated Admin Personal Notifications**: Admin user panel now shows only their own personal notifications. All administrative approval requests are exclusively shown in the Admin Panel.
*   **Supervisor Quotes & Audit Log Access**: Supervisors can now view all users' quotes, monthly/daily entry lists, and system audit logs, matching admin-level data visibility.
*   **Light/Dark Theme Sync**: Theme toggle in the Navbar now propagates correctly to all sub-workspaces (Chuti, Quotes) in real-time.
*   **Circular UI Components**: Standardized all checkboxes as perfect circles.
*   **Password Setup Enforcement**: Automated modal lock to force new users using default credentials `1234` to update their login passwords.

### 🚀 v1.0.0 (First Official Release)
*   **Unified Workspace Launch**: Integrated both Leave Tracker (Chuti) and Quotes Manager workspaces under a single secure application shell.
*   **Inline User Configuration**: Replaced popup modals with a reusable, highly responsive inline settings panel (`StaffSettingsForm`) for editing and adding staff profiles.
*   **Circular UI Components**: Standardized all checkboxes as perfect circles.
*   **Slide Transitions**: Added smooth CSS sliding animations to all toggle switches.
