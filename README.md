# 🌟 QC App — Unified Office Leave Tracker & Quotes Manager

**Version 2.0.1** | A premium, modern, and high-performance desktop and web utility built with **Next.js (TypeScript)**, **Supabase (PostgreSQL)**, and **Tauri v2**. It integrates two comprehensive corporate workspaces under a single secure, role-based role management structure.

---

## 🚀 Workspace Ecosystem

The QC App consists of two primary corporate workspaces, accessible dynamically based on administrator-configured employee access permissions:

### 1. 📅 Leave Tracker Workspace (Chuti)
*   **Sign-In / Sign-Out Panel**: One-click logging of daily attendances with customizable default shifts.
*   **Live Work Hours Tracking**: Realtime calculation of daily office hours and active break durations.
*   **Leave Submissions**: Request workflows for 4 distinct leave categories:
    - **Full Leave** (Annual leave and Eid vacation days)
    - **Short Leave** (Hourly personal absences)
    - **Overtime** (Logging of extra hours)
    - **Reserve Holiday** (E.g., working on official holidays to bank leave days)
*   **Government Holiday Banners**: 
    - Users with reserve capabilities enabled can choose between taking holiday pay ("Get Paid") or reserving it for future leave adjustment ("Reserve").
    - Users with reserve disabled automatically receive pay addition notifications (bypassing unnecessary screens and admin approvals).
*   **Bulk Full Leave Submission**: Add up to 10 separate dates simultaneously using an interactive calendar panel. In supervisor/admin dashboards, these dates are grouped into a **single, unified action row** for one-click approval, rejection, or revision request.
*   **Leave Deficit Adjustments**: Easily request adjustments using accrued overtime hours or reserve holidays to offset short leave deficits.

### 2. 📝 Quotes Manager Workspace
*   **Compliance Audit Panel**: Conduct deep compliance rules checking on corporate document types (e.g. PDF/Excel quotes).
*   **Rules & Configuration Engine**: Administrators and authorized managers can create, edit, or delete compliance checking rules, viewing execution histories.
*   **Category Checklist Selector**: Permissions specify allowed document categories (e.g. Van, Bike) per staff account.
*   **Can Manage Rules Permission**: Restricts compliance database edits to specific staff members (always allowed for Admins).

---

## 🔑 Administrative Control & Dashboard

A master control panel allows Administrators and Supervisors to oversee company-wide operations:
*   **Employee 360° Profile Hub**: Clicking any staff in User Management opens a full hub — Leave History, Quotes History, KPI & Performance, and Profile Settings sub-tabs — for a complete employee overview.
*   **Switchable Notification Panels**: Admins toggle between the Admin Approval Panel (detailed request cards) and their personal User Notification Panel. Session preference is remembered.
*   **Inline User Configuration**: The old pop-up modals have been replaced by a premium inline settings page (`StaffSettingsForm`). Setting up a new staff account or editing an existing profile uses the exact same layout.
*   **Circular UI Components**: All checkbox selectors (Leave settings, Govt Holidays, Overtime, Reserve, Can Manage Quote Rules) are styled as perfect circular inputs.
*   **Smooth Slide Transitions**: Workspace access toggles feature premium sliding toggle track animations.
*   **Standardized Field Heights**: All dropdown selectors and text fields are locked to consistent heights (`h-[36px]`) to align perfectly.
*   **Password Setup Enforcement**: Users logging in with the default password `1234` are immediately presented with a credentials modal, blocking dashboard navigation until they specify a custom secure password.
*   **Automatic 10-Minute Lockout**: New accounts must complete their profile within 10 minutes, backed by a persistent localStorage timestamp preventing timer bypass on reboot or window closing.
*   **Cascading Profile Deletion**: Removing a user account triggers PostgreSQL cascade constraints to clean up all related attendance, leaves, rules, and push subscriptions.

---

## 📶 Offline-First & Realtime Architecture

*   **PWA Service Worker (`sw.js`)**: Caches static assets for lightning-fast loading and offline availability. Restricts caching to GET requests to protect against cache poisoning.
*   **IndexedDB Sync Storage (`offlineSync.ts`)**: Locally queues signs, sign-outs, and leaves when offline, syncing automatically once connection is restored.
*   **Supabase Realtime Listeners**: Replication broadcasts instantly update metrics, list views, and tables on database changes without requiring manual refresh.
*   **Concurrent Push Notifications**: Integrates Web Push API using VAPID keys, with rate-limiting (maximum 1 request per 5 seconds per staff to prevent network spam). Admins and supervisors bypass rate limits to handle bulk approval actions.
*   **Tray Persistence (Tauri Desktop App)**: Minimizing or closing the app window hides it to the system tray, keeping it active in the background to deliver desktop notifications.

## 💻 Local Development Setup

### 1. Prerequisites
*   Node.js (v20 or higher)
*   Rust (v1.75+ for Tauri desktop compilation)
*   A Supabase database project

### 2. Database Setup
Execute the unified SQL script inside your Supabase project's SQL editor:
1.  Run the entire content of `supabase/schema.sql` (Initializes profiles, attendance tables, constraints, cascade rules, RLS policies, and database triggers).

### 3. Environment Config
Create a `.env.local` file in the project root:
```env
# Supabase Keys
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_public_key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_supabase_service_role_key

# Web Push Credentials
NEXT_PUBLIC_VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY=your_vapid_public_key
VAPID_PRIVATE_KEY=your_vapid_private_key
```

*Tip: You can generate VAPID keys using `npx web-push generate-vapid-keys`.*

### 4. Build & Run Commands

```bash
# Install NPM dependencies
npm install

# Run dev mode (Web browser)
npm run dev

# Run dev mode (Tauri Desktop App)
npm run tauri dev

# Check TypeScript compilations
npx tsc --noEmit

# Compile production web files

## 📜 Version History / Changelog

### 🔧 v2.0.1 — Patch Release (Current)
*   **Critical Tauri Login Fix**: Users were unable to log in on the desktop app (macOS/Windows) while the web version worked. Root cause was the Supabase client using auth defaults incompatible with Tauri's static WebView (no server-side redirect). Fixed with `detectSessionInUrl: false`, `flowType: 'pkce'`, and explicit `localStorage` binding.
*   **Auto-Updater Unified & Fixed**: Removed duplicate `QuotesAppUpdater`. The single `AppUpdater` now uses correct Tauri v2 detection (`__TAURI_INTERNALS__`), correct `check()` API, and `plugin-process relaunch()` (the old `custom_relaunch` Rust command didn't exist).
*   **macOS DMG Build Fix**: Added `chmod +x bundle_dmg.sh` CI step to fix `failed to bundle project` error on `aarch64-apple-darwin`.
*   **Password Reset RECOVERY Fix**: Changing a user password no longer falsely triggers the RECOVERY database restore system.

### 🚀 v2.0.0 — Major Release
*   **Employee 360° Profile Hub**: Clicking any staff in User Management now opens a full-featured hub with sub-tabs — Leave History, Quotes History, KPI & Performance, and Profile Settings — giving admins a complete employee overview in a single screen.
*   **Switchable Admin/User Notification Panels**: Admins can toggle between a detailed Admin Approval Panel (full leave/profile/password request cards with one-click actions) and a personal User Notification Panel. The last-opened panel preference is persisted per session.
*   **Newest-First Todo Ordering**: Newly added tasks always appear at the top of the todo list.
*   **Profile Change Detection Guard**: Profile update submissions are blocked if no fields were changed, eliminating redundant approval cards in the admin queue.
*   **Isolated Admin Personal Notifications**: Admin user panel now shows only their own personal notifications. All administrative approval requests are exclusively shown in the Admin Panel.
*   **Supervisor Quotes & Audit Log Access**: Supervisors can now view all users' quotes, monthly/daily entry lists, and system audit logs, matching admin-level data visibility.
*   **Light/Dark Theme Sync**: Theme toggle in the Navbar now propagates correctly to all sub-workspaces (Chuti, Quotes) in real-time.
*   **Comprehensive Light Mode Text Visibility**: All text across profile settings, checkboxes, form fields, tables, and modals now correctly resolves to readable dark text in Light Mode via CSS variable-based theming.
*   **Password Reset RECOVERY Fix**: Fixed a critical bug where changing a password triggered the RECOVERY system to falsely attempt a full database restore due to a transient Supabase auth token refresh.
*   **Navbar Hover Tooltip**: Navbar displays only the user's name by default; hovering for 2 seconds reveals codename and account role in a glassmorphic tooltip. Verified badge shown for top performers.

### 🚀 v1.0.0 (First Official Release)
*   **Unified Workspace Launch**: Integrated both Leave Tracker (Chuti) and Quotes Manager workspaces under a single secure application shell.
*   **Inline User Configuration**: Replaced popup modals with a reusable, highly responsive inline settings panel (`StaffSettingsForm`) for editing and adding staff profiles.
*   **Circular UI Components**: Standardized all checkboxes as perfect circles.
*   **Slide Transitions**: Added smooth CSS sliding animations to all toggle switches.
*   **Space Correction inside Supervisor Lists**: Fixed a flexbox gap alignment bug that caused an unnecessary empty space on the left of supervisor check circles.
*   **Dev Mode Updater Quiet Mode**: App updater checks are now disabled in development environment to avoid console clutter.
*   **Cascading Cleanup Rules**: Programmed database cascades to delete associated records cleanly when removing a staff profile.
*   **Password Setup Enforcement**: Automated modal lock to force new users using default credentials `1234` to update their login passwords.
